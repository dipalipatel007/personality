            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">1 - Relax Your Way To The Top :<br><br><div>If you are looking to be charismatic, then the first and foremost thing that you have to do is to actually learn to relax. </div><br><div>Some people try too hard to be charismatic, but only end up making a fool of themselves. This is not something that you would want to do. </div><br><div>So, in order to work on your charisma, learn from the mistakes of others and relax. When you master the art of relaxing in a social setting, you automatically exude charisma. It's a known fact that people love to be around people who are calm and composed. </div><br><div>Learn to channelize peace and tranquility to everyone you know and meet. This will help you seem extremely calm and a lot more attractive. With a personality of this sort, apart from wanting to be with you, people may even aspire to be like you.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>2 - Confidence Concerns :</div><br><div>
</div><div>While being confident can be easily mistaken for being charismatic, there is a very distinct difference between being confident and being charismatic. </div><br><div>Charisma is that quality that makes you seem like you have an extremely attractive personality, and confidence is that quality that adds to your charisma. </div><br><div>Appearing confident can make you seem extremely charismatic, because your confidence apart from acting like a magnet will also help put the others around you at ease and create in them a desire to be around you. </div><br><div>Here, however, you will have to take a lot of care to stay away from going overboard, because while confidence is one thing, overconfidence is a different thing altogether and it's that one quality that no one can really be fond of.</div><br><div>3 - Be Considerate :</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>You are truly a considerate person when you treat others around you just the way you would want to be treated.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>You wouldn't want to be discriminated against under any grounds, so then there is no reason why you should treat one person differently from the other.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Exercise this behavior pattern in your day-to-day life and watch how people are attracted to you like bees are to honey.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>4 - Dish Out Attention :</div><br><div>
</div><div>In order to seem charismatic, it is important to listen and pay attention. When you manage to do this your charisma quotient automatically reaches new heights. </div><br><div>You can pull off attention tactics by simply listening to what people have to tell you and talk as less as possible. However, when you actually do talk, make sure you talk sense and make sure the words that are coming out of your mouth are the kind of words that the other person would want to listen to. </div><br><div>Make it a point to smile while you are talking. This will help add quite a lot of appeal to your personality.</div><div><br></div></div>
