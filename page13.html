            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">1 - Breathe Deeply
 :<br><br><div>Though it is an old and repeated technique, nevertheless it really works well. Comfort yourself in a relaxing position and take a deep breath. Hold your breath and start releasing slowly. </div><br><div>As your breath leaves you, assume as though you are breathing out fire. To feel the fire exiting from within you, place your hand underneath your nose.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>2 - Exercise
 :</div><div><br></div><div>Exercising is, indeed, the best technique for calming down. Move out and indulge yourself into vigorous aerobic exercises for a longer duration than normal to release the pain and anger within you. </div><br><div>Also, you can take up running as all it matters is finishing the run rather than worrying about the reasons for your stress. Push yourself against the barbell or the fitness equipment. This would help your mind to focus on nothing else, but finishing the exercise.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>3 - Close Your Eyes
 :</div><div><br></div><div>Gently close your eyes and retreat from the present world going deeper and deeper. Let those drops moisten your eyelids helping you regain your equilibrium. You will gradually get back your balance and proper focus.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>4 - Move Outdoors
 :</div><div><br></div><div>Whenever you are in an agitated mood, give yourself an hour to indulge into the beauty of the nature.</div><br><div> Whether you are angry, opinionated, cynical or uptight, you will soon return home as a relaxed person. Engage yourself into some activities, say walking, biking, running or swimming, in order to clam yourself down.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>5 - Find Your Way To Water
 :</div><div><br></div><div>All you guys, who had assumed water to be only a thirst quencher, think again! The various healing and mood effects of water can do wonders to calm you quickly. </div><br><div>So, the next time whenever you are over aroused, drink a big glass of water every hour. Besides, you can take a walk along the water, take a look at it or listen to it. If possible, throw yourself into it by going for a bath or swim.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>6 - Step Back
 :</div><div><br></div><div>Take a step back and observe the world that you are living in. Lift your head up and look at the stars in the sky. </div><br><div>Realize the number of stars filled with many planets just like one of ours. Compare your problem with one of those twinkling stars? Probably, it is just a fight between two ants. </div><br><div>In the event of so many serious problems, yours would not seem as a big deal. All it requires is some framing of things and events here and there. And voila! You'll have the solution to your problem in a few moments.</div></div>
