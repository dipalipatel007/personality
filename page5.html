            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">1 - Understand Your Fear
 :<br><br><div>Try to understand why you fear or what causes you to fear. Only when you have identified the source of your fear can you start on the process of overcoming it. You can start by listing all your fears on your notepad and then striking them off once you have overcome them.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>2 - Breathe Deep :</div><br><div>
</div><div>Taking deep breaths when you are scared or worried helps you relax to a great extent. Make sure that you exhale longer than you inhale. </div><br><div>Fear will automatically reduce since you will also calm down. This can also help you to think things out effectively. Breathing exercises can be practiced during meditation.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>3 - Chalk Out A Plan &amp; Be Positive :</div><br><div>
</div><div>Always have a plan for situations which may not bring you certain results. For instance, you may be afraid to attend an interview in fear of being rejected. </div><br><div>You may also fear a date for similar reasons or may feel scared about losing your job as you do not know how life will be after that. </div><br><div>But in all these situations, you can chalk out a plan beforehand, a plan which will bring you favorable results and thus kill all fears. Though plans do not work always, a positive attitude always does, therefore think positive in every walk of life.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>4 - Confront Your Fears :</div><br><div>
</div><div>Many people are scared of something specific, like being in the dark or driving or swimming. If you too fall in the same category, make it a point to learn the thing that you fear doing. </div><br><div>Even if you fail once or twice, don't give up on your hope and practice hard to overcome your fear. Switch off the lights when you are alone in a room and see what happens. </div><br><div>You can be assured that nothing is going to attack you! Once when you have confronted your fear by actually performing the same thing that you fear, you will successfully kill your fear.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>5 - Boost Up Confidence :</div><br><div>
</div><div>Sometimes, fear is the result of extreme low belief in oneself and low confidence. Practice exercises which help to boost self confidence. </div><br><div>For example, you can stand in front of the mirror and pretend to speak to a stranger, so that you do not have to fear mingling with a new group of people the next time you come across one. This exercise can also help you overcome stage fright.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>6 - Seek Medical Help :</div><br><div>
</div><div>If nothing seems to be working for you and you still feel intermittently scared, there is no harm in seeking medical help, for who knows, after a couple of sessions, you might actually be able to ward off your fear. </div><br><div>Nowadays, there are psychiatrists who help people to overcome their fear and shortcomings. However, resort to this, only when all the above have failed.</div></div>
