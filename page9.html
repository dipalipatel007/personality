It will make you less defensive and allow you to analyze the statement of other person deeply. <br><br>You should listen to the other person with patience and give a logical approach to the same. Let the other person complete what he/she wants to say. <br><br>Once he/she is done, give your feedback. This would allow both of you to lay forward your view point. However, make sure that whatever is said is logical and pertains to the present situation.<br><br>
<div>2 - Never think that you are always right. If people have been correcting you time and again, know that there is some problem which lies inside you. </div><br><div>Accept that you have a problem of arguing on small issues and work on it to exclude the same from your behavior. Accepting your weakness will strengthen your relationship. Also, ask them to help you come out of the problem.</div><br><div>
</div><div>3 - Inculcate understanding in yourself. Instead of thinking about your own issues, try to understand the other person's views, feelings, state of mind, etc. </div><br><div>This will help you to talk calmly and make the relationship a strong one. After understanding the other person, your approach will not be illogical or defensive. The feedback will be based on the feelings of both the people and not only yours.</div><br><div>
</div><div>4 - Introspect yourself and increase your self control power. Also, be aware of the place and people around before heading towards an argument. </div><br><div>A couple must never involve in the argument in front of their children. It may have a bad impact on them. Respect each other to share great relationship.</div><br><div> Similarly, indulging in a heated argument in a public place such as a mall or cinema hall would make people think of you as uncivilized.</div><br><div>
</div><div>5 - Be positive in your thinking. It will exclude negativity from inside and you will have a healthy approach towards any issue. </div><br><div>If you have positive nature, you will never get involved in any kind of argument.</div><br><div>
