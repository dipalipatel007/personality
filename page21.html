    <div class="container">
        <div class="inner-container" style="width: 100%;">
            <hr class="line" style="width: 10%;">
            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5"><div><span style="font-size: calc(1.175rem + (0.325 * ((100vw - 20rem) / 28)));">Friends, have you noticed that when a strong faith breaks down, then it breaks down .... </span></div><br><div><span style="font-size: calc(1.175rem + (0.325 * ((100vw - 20rem) / 28)));">1 - Let's see some example :&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>It was believed that for a human being, it is impossible to run 100 meters within 10 seconds, </div><br><div>then one day Jim Hines broke this belief in 9.95 second by breaking this belief ... and after that till today no matter how many athletes Have shown the show ...</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>2 - Talking about Bollywood :</div><div><br></div><div>Earning 100 crores for any film was considered impossible ... Then Ghajini came and showed me these fashions ... and after that, Bollywood got a glimpse of movies that made 100 crores ...</div><div><br></div><div>Salman Khan's films are so consistent Succeeded in doing this later ...</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>In the same way, you can also see in some other fields when there is a record which people considered earlier impossible.</div><br><div> Then one after another many people go on breaking it.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>3 - Why does this happen ?</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Because the formation of the record breaks the strong belief that has been sitting in people for years. </div><br><div>The first task that our mind thought was impossible, now seems to be possible ... and when our mind accepts something like this, then it prepares our body to do that work ... </div><br><div>Now it does not matter that it can happen Is it or not ... Now there is complete focus on how to do this ... and ultimately we put it to the tax ... the faith breaks down ..</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>That means Hermi BELIEF or our belief can also make us work and stop it from doing it.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>4 - Where do you live in captivity of such a belief?</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>You may have unknowingly created some of your personal limiting beliefs, I can not do it, I can not do it ... </div><br><div>For example : Because no one has done business in my family so I can not even do it ... or I have been weak in studies so that no competition can beat ... I am a girl, so I can not work outside ... I can not make anything rich!</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>If you are in captivity of such a belief then get rid of it today ... you can do anything ... you just have to convince your belief system that yes you can ...</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>"A man watched the legs of some giant elephants tied with ropes ... he was surprised how so powerful elephants are tied to these minor ropes ... they can break it whenever they want ...., </div><br><div>He said this curiosity to his Mahatte said, "Actually, when these elephants are born, then we keep them tied with these ropes ... since then they are weak, so try not to break it even after repeated attempts. They may, and they are also understand that when they grow up can not break the bond and do not make it ... "</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Friends, unfortunately, this does not happen only with elephants, we humans make the condition of your mind in such a way and this is usually on the subconscious level, so you do not care about it ... just observe that you do not even have anything like that. </div><br><div>You have not done any thing ... you have not been convinced by any belief that makes you weak .If only then get rid of it ... </div><br><div>Break this belief ... and do whatever you want to do ... </div><br><div>Once you You will do this then do it again Area will be ... you and will also go limiting beliefs stretching and you will improve your life.</div></div>
