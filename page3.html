            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">1 - Exercise Your Brain :<br><br>
<div>Just like you workout to build and strengthen your muscles, your brain, too, requires proper exercises to sharpen itself. Often, it is assumed to be a useless body part, but this is not true. </div><br><div>As such, whenever you are engaging yourself in some activities, you are exercising your brain. Consider practicing activities, such as puzzles, crafts, reading, painting, gardening, and other recreational activities that will refresh and rejuvenate you and your mind, in particular.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>2 - Read Quality Books :</div><br><div>
</div><div>Most of us love reading. But we often end up reading fiction, suspense, or romantic books. However, these books do not mentally stimulate us. </div><br><div>So, if you really want to improve your thinking and writing skills, pick up books that force you to really focus. Read a classic novel that changes your perspective towards this world and exposes you to precise, elegant English. </div><br><div>Do not feel shy to pick up new words and find their meanings. This, in turn, will make you smarter with a more comprehensive vocabulary. Make reading fun as well as useful.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>3 - Avoid The Idiot Box :</div><br><div>
</div><div>What do we do after a long tiring working day? Pick up a bag of chips and a can of cola only to land up in front of the television. Though there is no problem with refreshing yourself while watching a reality or a talk show, it doesn't really put your mental capacity into use. </div><br><div>Further, watching television continuously does not relax you, instead, it exhausts you. Hence, pick up a book or magazine when you want to relax. Or, switch off the idiot box when you have friends or acquaintances around and indulge in a conversation instead.</div><br><div>4 - Identify Your Qualities
 :</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>All of us have had our share of several idols and dream jobs during childhood. A scientist, a social worker, an airhostess, a 40-wheel lorry driver, an astronaut, or even a rock star! But, in reality, how many of us are really able to convert our childhood dreams into a reality? Probably, just one out of hundred. </div><br><div>That's because to move onto their paths, we need to understand the values, commitment, and endless efforts to meet the requirements and achieve our goals. However, this should not be mixed with our idols. </div><br><div>For example, if we try to imitate our idols, we will only land up making a fool out of ourselves and not creating a niche amongst the rest. Hence, it is important to identify your qualities and be yourself rather than being others.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>5 - Learn Language :</div><br><div>
</div><div>Researches indicate that learning an unknown foreign language boosts brain power. </div><br><div>Quite smart, indeed, right! Learning and understanding the foreign culture through the language induces your brain to implement its muscles.</div></div>
