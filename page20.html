            <hr class="line" style="width: 10%;">
            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5"><div>1. One Goal :</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>Whenever I'm down a bit, I have found that this often happens because there is a lot going on together in my life.</div><br><div> I'm trying to do a lot. And it eliminates my energy and motivation. Perhaps this is the most common mistake that people do: they try to do a lot together. </div><br><div>If you try to achieve two or more goals at a time, then you can not keep energy and focus on your goal (the two most important things to achieve). </div><br><div>This is not possible - I have tried many times. You have to choose one goal for now and focus on it completely. I find it hard, but I'm telling from my experience. </div><br><div>Once you reach your present goal, then you can achieve your remaining goals.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>2. Find Inspiration :</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>I get inspiration from those people who have already achieved what I want to do, or those people who are doing what I want to do. </div><br><div>I read blogs, books, magazines of others. I do my goals Google, and read success stories. Zen Habits is one of those places, not only from me but also from many other readers who have received wonderful things.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>3. Get Excited :</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>This sounds very obvious in listening, but most people do not think much about it. If you want to get out of despair, then be excited for any goal. </div><br><div>But if you do not feel motivated then how will you feel excited? </div><br><div>Well, it starts with inspiration from others, but you have to take enthusiasm from others to change it in your energy. </div><br><div>I have found that I talk to my wife and other people, read more about this, and visualize it Seeing the benefits of achieving goal goals in mind), how do I feel successful, I feel excited. </div><br><div>Once this is done, then it is necessary to carry the same energy ahead and move forward.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>4. Publish your goal :</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>Take a big print out of your goal. Write your goal in few words, like a ("Exercise 15 mins. Daily"), and paste it on your wall or fridge. </div><br><div>Put it in your own home in your office, put it on your computer's desktop. You want to set big reminders for your goals, so that you can focus on your goal and be excited about it. </div><br><div>Applying a picture related to your goal can also be helpful.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>6.Commit publicly :</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>Nobody wants to look bad in front of others. We do extra efforts to do what we have said publicly. </div><br><div>For example, when I wanted to run my first marathon race, then I started writing a column about it in my local newspaper. The whole population of my city knew about this goal. </div><br><div>Now I could not move back, though my motivation was getting less, but I was holding this goal and finished the race.</div><br><div> You do not need to commit your goal in any newspaper, but you can call it your family, friends, and You can tell from co-workers, and if you have a blog then you can write about it too. </div><br><div>And responsible responsibilities yourself - Do not commit only once, but every week or month update about your progress.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>7. Think about it daily :</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>If you think about your goal everyday, then it is more likely to complete. </div><br><div>That is why it is helpful to place your goal on the wall or on the desktop. It is also helpful to send reminder to yourself every day. </div><br><div>And if you do this small job every five minutes everyday then it is almost certain that your goal will be fulfilled.</div></div>
